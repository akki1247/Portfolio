# Portfolio of Akshay Shiralsheth.

SEO improvements made on 2025-09-28:

- Added primary meta tags: title, description, and keywords in `index.html`.
- Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for better sharing previews.
- Added JSON-LD structured data (Person) to help search engines understand the owner.
- Added canonical link to the site home URL.
- Improved image `alt` attributes and added `loading="lazy"` for large images.
- Ensured external links to GitHub and LinkedIn open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Added `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` at the project root.

How to verify and next steps:

1. Upload the updated files to your hosting (Netlify) and confirm `https://www.akshay-shiralsheth.netlify.app/sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are reachable.
2. Use Google Search Console: add your site, submit the sitemap URL, and inspect pages.
3. Use the Rich Results Test (https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate the JSON-LD structured data.
4. Use the URL Inspection tool in Search Console to request indexing for important pages.
5. Keep content fresh: add a blog or project write-ups to attract search traffic and use target keywords naturally.

If you want, I can also:
- Generate localized meta tags or multi-language support.
- Create individual pages for each project and add them to the sitemap.
- Optimize images (compress and create srcset) to improve performance and Core Web Vitals.
